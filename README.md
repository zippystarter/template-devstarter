Devstarter is one-page developer portfolio template

It's fully compatible with shadcn's theming system. To see the template in action and change the theme, head on over to

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

Install the dependencies. I recommend using `pnpm`. If you want to use `npm`, just replace pnpm with `npm`.

```bash
pnpm install
```

Then, start the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Notes

This template makes use of modern CSS features such as CSS Grid & Subgrid.

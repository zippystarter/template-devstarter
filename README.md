# Devstarter - by Zippystarter

Devstarter is one-page developer portfolio template
from [Zippystarter](https://zippystarter.com). It's built
with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and [shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com).

This [shadcn template](https://zippystarter.com/templates/devstarter) is fully
compatible with shadcn's theming system.

To experiment with [shadcn themes](https://zippystarter.com/themes), head on
over to
the [shadcn theme generator](https://zippystarter.com/tools/shadcn-ui-theme-generator/demo/dev-one?utm_source=https://github.com/zippystarter/template-devone)
where you'll be able to apply themes to the template and export them for your
own use.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

Install the dependencies. I recommend using `pnpm`. If you want to use `npm`, just replace pnpm with `npm`.

```bash
pnpm install
```

Then, start the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Notes

This template makes use of modern CSS features such as CSS Grid & Subgrid &
mix-blend-mode.
